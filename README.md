# Real-Time Object Dimension Measurement with OpenCV

A Python script that detects specific colored objects in real-time using a webcam and estimates their width dimensions using OpenCV computer vision techniques.

## Features
- Real-time object detection using HSV color space filtering
- Contour-based object segmentation
- Width calculation and overlay display
- Bounding box and crosshair visualization
- Adjustable parameters for different use cases

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Computer Vision Techniques:
  - HSV Color Space Filtering
  - Image Thresholding
  - Contour Detection
  - Bounding Box Calculations
